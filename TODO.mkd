# TO DO or Wishlist

 * Try to minimize absolute paths everywhere

 * By default in `.profile` (at least in Ubuntu), `~/bin` is added to the
   path, consider putting scripts in that directory

 * Add a `.profile` that sources the original profile

 * Replace the `Rakefile` with an install script written in Bash (need to find
   a way to replace the `.erb` templates).
