# Jacobo de Vera's Dot Files

These are the configuration files I want to have in every Linux box I use.

## Contents

My bash configuration files live in a _.bash.d_ directory. All the contents in this directory are sourced by _.bashrc_.

My Vim configuration directory includes all the plug-ins I have installed.

Some configuration files, like .gitconfig, are generated from a Ruby _.erb_ template. I have copied this idea from [Ryan Bates](http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles), together with an initial version of my _Rakefile_.


### Vim configuration

I am using the great [pathogen plug-in](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script\_id=2332) for Vim, which allows for a convenient way of organising Vim addons. It makes every directory under ~/.vim/bundle part of Vim's runtime path. Plug-ins are contained within their private directory and can be deleted easily by simply removing their directory.

All add-ons in the official Vim's website are actively mirrored in github by the [Vim-Scripts.org](http://vim-scripts.org/) project. They can be added as git submodules within the bundle directory and thus easily be kept up to date.

## Installation

    git clone --recursive git://github.com/jdevera/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    bash install
