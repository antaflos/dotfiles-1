# The local Directory

This directory is intended to contain bash configuration files that are
specific for the local machine.

All the files within this directory are sourced by bash upon start up *after*
the ones in the parent directory. However, the files in this directory are not
tracked by git.

This can be used for configurations that depend on a particular piece of
hardware being available, or to have a different shell prompt for different
machines, etc. I use it to store all my work-specific configuration so that I
can keep a common base environment in all my home and work computers.

Since the local directory is ignored, you can also initialise a different git
repository in it.
